# snippets

This is a simple script for creating my Alfred Snippet collections.

Stuff to write down:

* Why are text expansion snippets?
* Why in Git?
* Package format
* Personal info

## Usage

```console
$ python3 create_snippets.py
```

Then open the created `.alfredsnippets` files.

## Notes

It's possible to import Text Replacements in macOS Settings, and they sync to iOS devices.
The behaviour is slightly different: you have to keep typing to accept the suggestion, rather than having it auto-expand.
But might be worth checking out!
